Automobile Engineers develop car bodies and build-ups with aggregates like engines clutches gears and steering.#<b>Overview</b><br><br><p>With the rapid expansion of the automobile industry in India there is a growing need for trained professionals to design develop manufacture and repair automobiles.</p><p>Keeping pace with the demand for more sophisticated and fuel efficient cars the automobile engineering course has become increasingly relevant. Engineers will have to not only meet higher quality standards but also production deadlines and implement innovative technologies for reduced emissions and greater fuel efficiency.</p><p>The field activity of a qualified engineer in Automobile Engineering comprises ofdevelopment (construction calculation and testing) priming of work fabrication and observation of the functionality of vehicles. Automobile Engineers develop car bodies and build-ups with aggregates like engines clutches gears and steering.</p><p>During the design process they have to take into mind considerations such as aerodynamics and style. At the same time functionality safety and optimisation of resources have to be addressed.</p><p>We are proud to offer Lean Six Sigma(LSS) Green belt certification to our final year students after they complete their eighth semester Internship Project.#NAN#NAN#NAN#Chemical Engineering#B.Tech in Chemical Engineering is designed to impart both theoretical and experimental knowledge#<b>Overview</b><br><p>B.Tech in Chemical Engineering is designed to impart both theoretical and experimental knowledge and the curriculum includes</p><li>Chemical Engineering laboratories with sophisticated equipment.</li><li>A computer lab with softwares such as ASPEN ANSYS (CFD)</li><li>IAESTE technical training program in which students visit countries like USA Germany Poland Turkey Spain Denmark.</li>#NAN#NAN#NAN#Civil Engineering#Civil engineering is one of the oldest and most popular streams in engineering.

It caters to the requirements of the students in almost all the engineering and other non-engineering disciplines of the University. The department aims to become a Centre of excellence in providing in-depth technical knowledge and opportunities for innovation and research with state-of-art computer facilities.#https//jaipur.manipal.edu/foe/schools-faculty/schools-list/scit/computer-science.html#NAN#NAN#NAN#Mechanical Engineering#The Department of Mechanical Engineering was established in Manipal University Jaipur in 2011. Mechanical Engineering is one of the major streams in the engineering profession and its principles are involved in the design study development and construction of nearly all of the physical devices and systems.#https//jaipur.manipal.edu/foe/schools-faculty/schools-list/samm/mechanical-engineering.html#NAN#NAN#NAN#Electronics & Communication Engineering#The Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering(ECE)Manipal University Jaipur is a centre for advanced research and teaching. The department aims at becoming a leading department that has introduced courses to students that covers larger domains of curriculum such as robotics imaging RF engineering Low power VLSI MEMS nanotechnology microwave engineering and antenna microchips and many more.#https//jaipur.manipal.edu/foe/schools-faculty/schools-list/seec/electronics-communication-engineering.html#NAN#NAN#NAN#Mechatronics Engineering#The Department of Mechatronics Engineering was established at Manipal University Jaipur in 2012. Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field of engineering with a rich knowledge base formed by various disciplines of engineering. Hence an integrated curriculum is designed so to provide a broad-based education in the basic principles of electrical electronics computing mechanical and control systems. Such a varied and diverse course is gaining much recognition and importance with every passing day and has become an engineering discipline high on demand.#https//jaipur.manipal.edu/foe/schools-faculty/schools-list/samm/mechatronics-engineering.html#NAN#NAN#NAN";
